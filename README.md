## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is another front-end challenge attempt. Tried a mobile first approach, with a media query for tablet and bigger.

Had fun with flex, and how easy it makes it to change the layout. Starting to experiment with utility classes.

### Continued development

This is my first solution that uses media queries, with two fixed sizes.

Would like to experiment with widths that change according to the viewport.
